# Pokemon Survey

Quite stupid survey created for self-learning purpose

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## TODO

- [ ] Use next/image to handle image caching and better rendering
- [ ] Maybe move images to bulbapedia
- [ ] Persist data fetched from PokemonAPI
- [ ] Create the results page with counting/sorting
